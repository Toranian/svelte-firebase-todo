# Todo List Application in Svelte + Firebase
A simple Svelte application to get used to Firebase. Hoping to use more of both in the future for personal projects.

## Getting Started
First, clone or download the repository using the big green button in the upper right of the screen.

Open a terminal in the newly created directory, and type `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

Next, type `npm run dev` and open the suggested url in the terminal. 

## Connecting to Firebase
Open a new project on Firebase, and create a new web based instance. Copy the values into the .env file in order to use Firebase effectively.



## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
